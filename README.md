# CTR Prediction

This assignment is a part of a Kaggle challenge, which deals with a real-world ctr prediction problem that belongs to the recommendation systems area.
A commercial company provided their raw data files, including anonymous information regarding users' features and habits. 

Working on this challenge contains two main parts. In this part, we demonstrate the process of features analysis and selection before model selection and implementation.

Followed by our analysis process,  we were able to carefully choose the most significant variables and indicate correlations and effects of the examined variables. 

This example demonstrates a standard and simple features analysis process that can be generalized for similar and different problems.
